# Sentra – Security Monitoring FAQ

This FAQ explains how Sentra reports security activity and how to interpret weekly summaries.

---

## Is “Low (Reviewed)” a security alert?

No.

**Low (Reviewed)** means:
- Security-sensitive administrative changes were detected
- These changes match expected maintenance behavior
- Activity has been reviewed or is reviewable without urgency

No immediate action is required unless the activity was unplanned.

---

## What triggers “Action Recommended”?

Only **explicit, unverified activity** triggers *Action Recommended*, such as:
- Unexpected administrative changes
- Activity that does not align with known maintenance windows
- Deviations that require operator confirmation

Raw activity volume never triggers this state.

---

## Why don’t login counts increase risk?

Sentra measures **behavior**, not volume.

Multiple logins or sessions are normal in managed environments.
Counts are reported for visibility but are always interpreted in context.

---

## Does Sentra provide real-time alerts?

Yes, for high-priority signals.

While Sentra's primary output is the **Weekly Security Summary**, priority alerts are triggered for signals with a risk score of $\ge 0.5$ (e.g., destructive commands or sustained brute force). These are delivered via Slack or Webhook integrations.

---

## What are “AI Recommendations”?

In Phase 4, every signal includes a **Suggested Action**. 
This is a context-aware recommendation generated by Sentra's behavior engine to help non-technical users understand how to respond (e.g., *"Verify if this maintenance was authorized"* or *"Consider rotating credentials"*).

---

## Do you block or remediate threats automatically?

No.

Sentra's philosophy is **Human-in-the-loop**.
We provide the **Playbooks** and **Recommendations**, but a human must authorize and execute any blocking or system changes. This ensures that legitimate maintenance is never accidentally disrupted.

---

## Is Sentra a SIEM?

No.

Sentra does not:
- Store logs long-term
- Provide search dashboards
- Correlate across data sources

Sentra complements SIEMs but does not replace them.

---

## Who should read Sentra reports?

Sentra reports are written for:
- Platform owners
- IT administrators
- Compliance reviewers
- Auditors

No security expertise is required to understand them.

---

## How does Sentra help with audits?

Sentra provides:
- Clear records of administrative activity
- Evidence of continuous access monitoring
- Human-readable explanations suitable for audits

This supports SOC 2, ISO 27001, and similar frameworks.
